## My process

i started by writing the html and styling with css. I choose to design a personal profile and since the profile photo i used didnt align with the hover colors in the project, i picked a different color for that.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

for the links,I had difficulty figuring out the parent or child container to add the width and height to. this i later figured out.
I was also able to make my work responsive.

### Continued development

I hope to work on more projects and improve my dev skills while at it.
